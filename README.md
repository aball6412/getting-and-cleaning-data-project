# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

### Project setup
The setup for the project is pretty easy. The key script here is called `run_analysis.R`. Running this script will automatically kick off the whole data retrieval and cleaning process. To get it up and running do the following:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open R Studio and change the working directory to wherever this repo was cloned to.
3. Load the `run_analysis.R` script into R Studio.
3. Hit the "source" button at the top right of the script to execute it. 

### Things to keep in mind
The dataset that was provided for this project should be downloaded when you clone this repo. However, if for some reason you change things around, make sure that the datasets provided by Coursera are located in the dataset folder of this directory. Otherwise, when you run the `run_analysis.R` script it will not be able to find the proper files to pull in.
